in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group.the champions of the social conceptions of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea that moral influence but this connection is quite impossible.the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires.the basis of authority is bodily violence. in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group.the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible.the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires.the basis of authority is bodily violence.
the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will.these bands of armed women submissive to a single will are what constitute the army.the army has always been and still is the basis of power.power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison in submission to one will.these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army.the army has always been and still is the basis of power.power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army
indeed it could not be otherwise.only under those conditions could a social organization be justified.but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification.even if there was once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government indeed it could not be otherwise.only under those conditions could the social organization be justified.but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification.even if there was once a time when owing to the low standard of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of government was
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between the individuals seemed still less and the life of the state seems even more secure.it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggling conquest.after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself.but this dressification is never more than temporary. between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between individuals seems still less and the life of the state seems even more secure.it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest.after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself.but this justification is never more than temporary.
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dissention individuals.government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion the duration and strength of the government.and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing after the furthest lemon beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden axe.the most convincing example of this is to internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals.government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government.and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs.the most convincing example of this is

this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out a hundred fifty years ago.every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies.the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of the state increases with its internal despotisms.the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out one hundred fifty years ago.every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies.the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism.the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impressors.this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service.in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoryness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons.but with universal military services it comes to pass that men after and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own oppressors.this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service.in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life to groups of persons.but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every
but instead of doing that they exposed the individual to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors.the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorbed the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend.the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social like vain and fruitless.but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not but instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors.the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend.the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless.but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only

except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country.we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence.so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil disposed people even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now.except for a state they tell us we should not have any religion education except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country.we know now that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence.so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil disposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now.except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture
without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything.this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago.the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects.without government's aid men would be enslaved by their neighbors. without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing any thing.this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago.the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects.without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors.
the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us.and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousand part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose.the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks.even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the states the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us.and if defense against barbarous nations is meant one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose.the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks.even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state
